# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Steps:

1. The Basic Authentication Token in index.js is a Base64 encoded string of test@liferay.com:test
   If you use a different user in your local installation you have to change it.
2. In the components there is a hardcoded sitekey for now, you can change this or add variables :) 
	(Tip: the sitekey can be found in Site settings )
3. Do yarn install
4. Do yarn start
